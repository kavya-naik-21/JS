    <!-- The console output you're getting suggests that all the scripts are executing as expected, 
    despite the innerHTML modification of the body tag. 
    This behavior may occur due to how the browser optimizes script execution. -->
    
    <!-- The innerHTML replacement technically removes the subsequent scripts from the DOM, 
     but it doesn't stop their execution if they've already started or been queued for execution. -->

     <!-- The scripts continue running because they were 
      already parsed and queued for execution before the DOM was modified. 
      If you need to dynamically update the DOM in a way that avoids unexpected behavior, 
      consider modifying specific parts of the DOM rather than replacing the entire innerHTML.
